* A demo project written in Java (JSX/React/Spring Boot)
* ...

* Description: 
     The system allows customers to create orders for a simple laundry and drying service (excluding ironing). When booking the service, customers can select a store from the list of stores provided by the system. Each store may have different service prices and service descriptions. The calculation of service charges is based on the weight of the laundry items and the washing time (express wash, quick wash, normal wash, etc.).

     Orders will be collected by platform staff and delivered to the laundry stores for processing. After completing the laundry, the stores will update the order status, and delivery staff will pick up the items and deliver them to the customers. Stores will not directly interact with customers but rather indirectly through the platform's services.

     The various actors involved in the system include Admin, Staff, Store, Customer, etc. Simple functions illustrate the workflow of tasks.
